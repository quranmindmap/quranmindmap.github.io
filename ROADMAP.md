    *   Display a mindmap using Mermaid.js for each Surah.
    *   Implement smooth transitions and animations for node expansion/collapse (if possible using transitions).
*   **Surah Grid:**
    *   Create a visually appealing grid layout for Surahs on the main page (`index.html`).
    *   Use Material Design cards for each Surah with clear titles, numbers, and translations.
    *   Implement hover effects and ripple effects on click (using CSS).
*   **Surah Pages:**
    *   Design individual Surah pages (`surahs/<surah-name>/<surah-name>.html`) with a consistent layout.
    *   Display the mindmap prominently.
    *   Include basic Surah information from `all_surahs.json` (e.g., number of verses, revelation type).
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Implement "Go Back" button on Surah pages.
    *   Consider adding breadcrumb navigation for easier orientation.
*   **Search:**
    *   Implement a basic search bar on the main page to find Surahs by name or number.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Use `all_surahs.json` for basic Surah metadata.
    *   Use `surah_summaries.json` to store mindmap data for each Surah.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Use a Material Design color palette.
    *   Use Material Design typography (Roboto font).
    *   Apply consistent spacing, shadows, and transitions.
*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   Ensure the application works well on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile devices). Use CSS media queries for responsiveness.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG guidelines).
    *   Use semantic HTML elements.
    *   Provide sufficient color contrast.
    *   Ensure keyboard navigation is possible.

    *   Deploy the application using GitHub Pages.

**Technology:**

*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks)
*   Mermaid.js
*   GitHub Pages for hosting

## Phase 2: Content and Features (Year 2)

**Goal:** Expand the mindmap content and add more interactive features.

    *   Use different node shapes or colors to represent different types of information.
*   **Multiple Tafsirs:**
    *   Create a dropdown menu on each Surah page to allow users to select different Tafsirs (Saadi, Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir, Jalalayn, etc.).
    *   Store mindmap data for each Tafsir separately (e.g., `data/tafsirs/saadi/al-fatiha.json`).
    *   Dynamically load and render the mindmap based on the selected Tafsir.
*   **Verse References:**
    *   Link specific nodes or sections of the mindmap to corresponding verses in the Quran.
    *   Display the verse text in a modal or pop-up when the user clicks on a linked node.
*   **Audio Integration:**
    *   Add audio playback functionality for each Surah.
    *   Allow users to select different reciters.
*   **Enhanced Search:**
    *   Implement a more advanced search that allows searching within Surah summaries and (eventually) Tafsir content.
*   **User Notes:**
    *   Allow users to add their own notes to Surah nodes (requires user accounts and a backend).

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Personalization (Year 3)

**Goal:** Introduce advanced features, personalization, and community aspects.

**Features:**

*   **Thematic Mindmaps:**
    *   Create mindmaps that connect themes and concepts across different Surahs.
*   **Cross-Referencing:**
    *   Automatically link related Surahs, verses, or concepts within the mindmaps.
*   **User Accounts (Optional):**
    *   Allow users to create accounts and save their preferences, notes, and bookmarks.
    *   This would require a backend (e.g., Node.js with a database).
*   **Customizable Mindmaps:**
    *   Allow users to create and edit their own mindmaps (this is a more advanced feature).
*   **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Allow users to track their progress in reading and understanding the Quran.
*   **Mobile App:**
    *   Consider developing a mobile app (iOS and Android) for a more native experience. You could use a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter.

## Phase 4: Community and Collaboration (Year 4)

## Phase 6: Scaling and Sustainability (Year 6)

**Goal:** Ensure the long-term sustainability of the project and scale to a larger user base.

**Features:**

*   **Community Moderation:**
    *   If you have social features, implement moderation tools to maintain a healthy community.
