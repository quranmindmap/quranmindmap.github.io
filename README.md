*   **Improve Existing Mindmaps:** Enhance the existing mindmaps with more details, connections, and insights.
*   **Add New Features:** Implement new features as described in the roadmap (e.g., multiple Tafsirs, search, user accounts).

*   **Write Documentation:** Improve the documentation to make it easier for others to use and contribute to the project.
*   **Add more translations:** Create more translation JSON files for different languages.
