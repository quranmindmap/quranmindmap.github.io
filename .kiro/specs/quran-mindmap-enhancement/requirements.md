# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the Quran Mindmap application to improve code quality, security, performance, and user experience. The application is a web-based tool that helps Muslims visualize and understand the Quran through interactive mind maps for each Surah.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Quality and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Quran Mindmap application, I want a clean, well-structured codebase so that I can easily add new features and fix issues without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN there SHALL be no duplicate CSS files
2. WHEN JavaScript files are reviewed THEN there SHALL be consistent error handling patterns across all files
3. WHEN the project structure is examined THEN there SHALL be a centralized utility system for common functions
4. IF a new Surah page is added THEN it SHALL use the standardized base template and scripts
5. WHEN code is modified THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and file organization

### Requirement 2: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user of the Quran Mindmap application, I want the application to be secure from XSS attacks so that my browsing experience is safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all content before rendering
2. WHEN HTML content is dynamically generated THEN the system SHALL use safe DOM manipulation methods
3. WHEN external libraries are loaded THEN they SHALL use strict security configurations
4. IF innerHTML is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with textContent or proper DOM methods
5. WHEN Mermaid diagrams are rendered THEN the security level SHALL be set to 'strict'

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user browsing Surah pages, I want fast loading times and responsive interactions so that I can efficiently study the Quran.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main page loads THEN it SHALL display a loading indicator during data fetching
2. WHEN searching for Surahs THEN the search SHALL be debounced to prevent excessive API calls
3. WHEN CSS files are loaded THEN there SHALL be only one consolidated stylesheet
4. IF network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN JavaScript files are loaded THEN there SHALL be minimal duplication of code

### Requirement 4: User Experience Improvement

**User Story:** As a Muslim studying the Quran, I want consistent and intuitive navigation across all Surah pages so that I can focus on learning rather than figuring out the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any Surah page THEN the page title SHALL correctly reflect the Surah name
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the styling SHALL be consistent across all pages
3. WHEN I encounter an error THEN I SHALL see a clear, helpful error message
4. IF I'm on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
5. WHEN mindmaps are displayed THEN they SHALL use a consistent rendering library (Mermaid.js)

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the Quran Mindmap application to be accessible so that I can use assistive technologies to study the Quran.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers are used THEN all content SHALL be properly labeled with ARIA attributes
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN there SHALL be alternative indicators
4. IF images or diagrams are present THEN they SHALL have descriptive alt text
5. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements

### Requirement 6: Data Structure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a content contributor, I want a well-structured data format for Surah information so that I can easily add comprehensive mindmap content for all 114 Surahs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Surah data is stored THEN it SHALL include complete metadata for all 114 Surahs
2. WHEN mindmap data is structured THEN it SHALL support hierarchical content organization
3. WHEN new Surah content is added THEN it SHALL follow a consistent JSON schema
4. IF Surah summaries are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the absence
5. WHEN data is fetched THEN it SHALL include proper error handling for missing or malformed data

### Requirement 7: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN they SHALL cover all utility functions
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify data loading and rendering
3. WHEN end-to-end tests are performed THEN they SHALL validate complete user workflows
4. IF code coverage is measured THEN it SHALL be at least 80% for critical functions
5. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 8: Build and Deployment Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated build process so that I can efficiently develop, test, and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is built THEN it SHALL be minified and optimized for production
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN they SHALL be compressed and cached appropriately
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL work consistently across different environments
4. IF dependencies are updated THEN the build process SHALL verify compatibility
5. WHEN code quality checks are run THEN they SHALL enforce consistent standards

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable error handling so that I receive helpful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the user SHALL see a retry option
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN data is missing THEN the application SHALL display appropriate fallback content
4. IF the application crashes THEN it SHALL recover gracefully without losing user context
5. WHEN errors are reported THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for troubleshooting

### Requirement 10: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the Quran Mindmap application to work seamlessly on my device so that I can study anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt to different screen sizes
2. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN they SHALL be optimized for finger navigation
3. WHEN mindmaps are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be readable and interactive
4. IF the device orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adjust appropriately
5. WHEN mobile performance is measured THEN it SHALL meet Core Web Vitals standards
