                      (4-8: Allah has sent down stories as a warning, but it has no effect)
                    (4: The punishment of hell and divine retribution are a result of their disbelief)
                The Messengers
                    (8-17: Examples of those who rejected the Messengers and were destroyed)

              Allah's Power and Warnings
                    (41-55: Allah's Power over His creation and His warnings)
                    (1-5: Allah has shown signs and the moon has split)
               The Reality of the Hereafter
