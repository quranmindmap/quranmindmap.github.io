        The Disbelievers
           (1-3: Allah renders the deeds of disbelievers invalid and leads them to destruction)
          (17-18: Those who disbelieve are far from divine guidance, and how it leads them astray)
          (20-23: Their disbelief leads to an increase in their evil actions and their bad outcome)

         (4-7: The Muslims will prevail, but need to be steadfast)

         (30-32: Disbelievers are recognized by the diseases of their hearts)
        (36-38: The reward is in the hereafter and not in this world, so seek that)

        (14: The Qur'an contains guidance that is needed by those who want to strive)
      Divine Justice and Divine Support
         (4: Allah is the All Knowing, All Wise)
         (4: Allah tests people so they will become known for their good or evil)
        (5, 15: Allah will make the believers steadfast and support them in their efforts)
        (14: Allah guides those who believe and who turn to Him for that guidance)
