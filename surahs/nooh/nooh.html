                The Mission and Message of Nooh
                    (1-4: Nooh was sent as a clear warner to his people)
                    (3: He called them to worship Allah and obey him)
                The Rejection of His People
                   (5-6: Nooh's people persisted in their disbelief)
                    (7: They reject his call)
                    (7: They try to avoid hearing the message)
                Nooh's Supplication and Allah's Response
                     (26: The nature of the disbelievers that made Nooh pray to Allah to destroy them)
                   (27: If they are left to live, they will do nothing but mislead)
                   (28: A Supplication to Allah for forgiveness)
                Allah's Power and Mercy
                  (10-12: Allah’s abundant blessings and promises for those who believe)
                   (17-20: Allah is the One Who created mankind and the earth and can bring about the resurrection)
             The Consequences of Disbelief
                  (25: Those who disbelieved will be punished)
                  (27: The disbelievers will only produce evil offspring)
              The Importance of Divine Revelation
                  (1-4:  Allah sent Nooh as a clear warner)
                  (21-24: Nooh is truthful)
