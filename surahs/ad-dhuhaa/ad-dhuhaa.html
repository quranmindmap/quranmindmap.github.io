        Divine Oaths and their Significance
             (1-2: Allah swears by the day and night)
       Allah's Favor to His Messenger
           (3-5:  Allah has not forsaken his Messenger nor does He hate him; rather Allah gives him an eternal reward)
       The Blessings Bestowed Upon The Prophet
            (6: He was an orphan whom Allah sheltered and protected)
             (7: He was unaware of the true path which Allah then guided him to)
           (8: He was in poverty, so Allah enriched him)
      The Importance of Guidance and Gratitude
         (9-10:  The need to be kind and merciful)
        (9-10: Do not turn away the orphan or the beggar)
           (11: Speak of Allah’s blessings)
