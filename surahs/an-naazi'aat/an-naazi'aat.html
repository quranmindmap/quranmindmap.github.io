                    (21-23:  Pharaoh rejected the signs of Moosa and disobeyed Allah)
                (25-26: Allah seizes the disbelievers for their sin, for he is the most strong and powerful)
              The Story of Moosa
                   (15-20: The story of Moosa being called to prophethood and shown great signs)
                   (17-21: Moosa was sent to pharaoh to enjoin belief in Allah and good conduct)
              Divine Power and Might
                (27-33:  Allah has created the universe, the earth, and all life, and sustains it)
                (27-33: Allah controls all creation)
              The Inevitability of Reckoning
                   (27-37: Allah has the power to recreate mankind, and all deeds will be made apparent)
                  (34-37: Those who deny the Truth will experience their punishment on that day)
                (38-41: Those who reject guidance will be punished severely)
                  (38-41: They will face punishment for having preferred this life and for rejecting truth)
