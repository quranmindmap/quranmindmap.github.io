    Soorat an-Naba': Central Subject - The Surah revolves around the Day of Judgement, the disbelievers’ denial of the great news, and the signs of Allah in His creation that serve as reminders of his power and majesty. It also emphasizes the difference in the destinies of the righteous and the disbelievers.

    Verses 1-3: The Great News and Questioning - These verses pose the question of what the disbelievers are asking each other about, and that it is about the great tidings (the Qur’an) concerning which they differ.

    Verses 6-16: Allah's Power and Signs in Creation - These verses emphasize Allah’s signs in creation, highlighting His blessings such as the earth, mountains, mankind being in pairs, the night for sleep, the day for livelihood, and the seven firmaments. They also emphasize the blessing of the rain and its effects.

    Verses 17-20: The Day of Judgement and Its Realities - These verses focus on the fact that the Day of Judgement has a specific time, and that the trumpet will be blown and people will gather on that day and the heavens will open and the mountains will be made to vanish.

    Verses 21-36: The Destinies of the Righteous and the Transgressors - The verses describe hell and its terrible torments as the destination of the transgressors, and the bliss of paradise for the righteous, as well as a promise of supreme triumph.

    Verses 37-40: The Warnings and Exhortations - These verses tell people to learn lessons and that it is not appropriate for them to adopt the traits of arrogance, for they will have to face a day of great reckoning, where Allah will deal with them as they are, and that those who disbelieve are destined for a terrible fate.
