                 The Condemnation of Faultfinders and Accumulators
                      (1: Woe to every backbiter, fault-finder)
                     (2: who accumulates wealth and keeps on counting it)
                False Hopes and Rejection of Accountability
                    (3: thinking that wealth will make him live forever)
                   (4: The disbelievers will surely be flung into the crushing fire)
             The Nature of the Punishment
                  (5: How terrible is hell)
                  (6-7: Allah’s own fire)
