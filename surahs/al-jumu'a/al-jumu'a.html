                Divine Grace and Messengership
                    (1: All in the heavens and earth glorifies Allah)
                   (2:  Allah sent an unlettered Messenger to humanity)
                   (2-3:  The Messenger recites, purifies, and teaches the Book and wisdom)
               The Believers
                    (4: Allah’s grace is given to whomever He wills)
                   (7-8: The believers should desire death, if they are truly Allah's friends)
                (9: The call to prayer should take precedence)
                 (9-11: The need to remember Allah in prayer and in all affairs)
              The Hypocrites and Disbelievers
                 (5: Those who do not benefit from the book are described as a donkey carrying tomes)
               (6-8: The Jews are told that they must wish for death if they are the chosen people of Allah)
                   (11: Worldly distractions should not interfere with worship)
              Importance of Faith and Worship
                   (2:   The Messenger's tasks of recitation, purification, and teaching)
               (2: To act according to the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah)
               (9-11: The need to prioritize prayer on Friday and remember Allah always)
