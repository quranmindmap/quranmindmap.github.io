                The Hypocrites' False Testimony and Actions
                    (1: They falsely testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)
                   (1: They use their oaths as a shield against criticism)
                   (4: They have an impressive outward appearance and eloquence but they are empty)
               Their True Nature and Fate
                   (1-3: They are liars who combine faith and disbelief)
                   (4: They are like propped-up wood)
                    (4-6: They are the enemy and are misguided)
                 (5: They are arrogant and turn away from being told the truth)
                (6: They will never be forgiven)
              The Believers' Conduct
                 (4-5: Believers should avoid listening to the hypocrisy of the disbelievers)
                 (11: The Believers should not forget that Allah has knowledge of their deeds)
             The Futility of Hypocrisy and Deceit
                 (7-8: The evil of seeking to harm the Messenger and plotting against him)
                    (9-11: No benefit will come from their behaviour)
                     (10: They will not be forgiven)
