        Divine Oaths and Their Significance
            (1-4: Oaths by the night and the day, and the creation of male and female)
         The Two Paths and Their Outcomes
            (5-7: Those who give in charity, fear Allah, and affirm the ultimate good, will have an easy path to salvation)
           (8-11: Those who are miserly, think themselves self-sufficient, and reject the ultimate good will have an easy path to perdition, and their wealth will not save them)
      The Divine Guidance
           (12: Allah is the provider of all guidance)
          (13: The hereafter and this world belong to Allah)
      The Consequences of Rejection
           (14-16: The fire of Hell is a warning for those who deny the truth)
      (17-21: Those who give for the sake of Allah and who are sincere will find blessings and will be well pleased)
