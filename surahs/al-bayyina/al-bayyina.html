               The Necessity of Clear Proof
                    (1-3: People of the Book and polytheists could not leave their ways until clear proof came to them)
                  The Nature of the Clear Proof
                    (2:  A Messenger reciting pages of purification)
                     (3: The pages contain writings of correctness)
                 The Purpose of the Clear Proof
                    (5: The purpose of this message was for people to worship Allah alone, with true faith, and to uphold prayer and zakat)
               Consequences of Accepting and Rejecting the Truth
                   (6: Disbelievers will abide in the Fire)
                  (7-8: Believers will be rewarded in the Gardens of Paradise)
